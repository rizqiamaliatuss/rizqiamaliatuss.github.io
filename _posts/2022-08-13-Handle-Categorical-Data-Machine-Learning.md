title: "How to Handle Catgorical Data in Machine Learning"
---

Most of Machine Learning can't handle categorical data, they expecte data to be numerical.
That's why we need to encode the categorical data to numeric.
There is some popular way to do it:

1. Label Encoding
2. Ordinal Encoding
3. One-Hot Encoding
4. Frequency Encoding

Note : In this post, I refer to [my Telco-Customer-Churn-Behaviour project](https://github.com/rizqiamaliatuss/Customer_Churn_Prediction) in repository

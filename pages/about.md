# About me 

Halo, welcome here!

I am Rizqi Amaliatus S, but you can call me just timtims
An Auditor in one of the paper-manufactured public companies based in Surabaya, graduated from Politeknik Elektronika Negeri Surabaya.

I have interested in data stuff, like analysing, visualising and bringing data for the greater good. 
Almost every day, I do code and deep dive into data because I love it. You can visit my portfolio here (asap) and my resume [Linkedin] (https://www.linkedin.com/rizqiamaliatuss).

Beside of doing that, I also enjoy reading (especially with my Kindle) and playing Jigsaw puzzle ^^

Last, let's connect. You can contact me on rizqiasm18 [at] gmail [dot] com.
